The work I have done within my major includes SQL, Pythong, Power BI, and Tableau. An example of my python work is called Mass Order and is within the portfolio. In the jobs I have had, I have not had to utilize many of the programs mentioned above besides Excel and Python. I have also only had to used Python within my own business and not in any internship I have had.
